- 👋 Hi, my name is Lisa Karolina. I have a background in the humanities, but am moving into the tech world :smile:
- 👀 I’m interested in Javascript, problem solving and other unrelated stuff like history, cooking and cats 🐈
- 🌱 I’m currently delving into web development
- 💞️ I’m constantly learning new things and I'm looking forward to learning more about the web and the technologies to create content for the web
